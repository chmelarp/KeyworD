<p>
"etaoin shrdlu" (eh-tay-oh-in shird-loo), was believed to be the twelve most 
common letters in the English language. The word came from linotype typesetting 
machines. The first, left row of six keys on a linotype machine produce the word 
"etaoin". The second, left row of six keys produce the word "shrdlu". The 
linotype machine keys are labeled: "etaoin-shrdlu-cmfgyp-wbvkxj-qz". The letter 
'h' appears more often in every day speech and writing than it does in a list of 
dictionary words. The first twelve letters "e t a o i n s r h l d c", are found 
in around 80% of the words in the English language.
